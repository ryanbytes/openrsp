# RSPduo evidence log

## Locally verified baseline

- USB vendor/product: `1df7:3020`
- USB device class: vendor-specific (`0xff`)
- Configurations: 1
- Interface 0 alternate 1: isochronous IN endpoint `0x81`, raw max-packet field `0x1400`
- Interface 0 alternate 2: isochronous IN endpoint `0x81`, raw max-packet field `0x0400`
- Interface 0 alternate 3: bulk IN endpoint `0x81`, max packet 512 bytes
- Serial descriptor: readable (value intentionally not recorded here)
- Model mapping: SDRplay's published VirtualHere guide states PID `3020` is RSPduo

## Destructive-interference observation

On 2026-07-12, opening and claiming interface 0 and then immediately releasing it used no vendor writes and made no alternate-setting change, but still caused the active SDRplay API client to report physical removal. The proprietary daemon remained running yet subsequently returned `Service Not Responding` on stream initialization. Therefore interface claim is classified as disruptive and must never be part of discovery or an unattended hardware test.

The USB descriptor alone does not establish control-transfer meaning, tuner registers, initialization, or IQ framing. The direct-streaming evidence below comes from the separately licensed GPL Mirics implementation and a hardware capture, not from descriptor inference.

## Direct streaming milestone

On 2026-07-12, the GPL Mirics backend with PID `0x3020` added initialized the connected RSPduo as tuner A with SDRplay's daemon fully unloaded. It set 2.048 MS/s, tuned to 100 MHz, selected bulk endpoint `0x81`, and captured 64,749,568 bytes during an eight-second bounded run. The capture contained changing interleaved 16-bit values rather than an empty or constant stream. This proves direct transport, volatile initialization, tuning calls, and sustained sample delivery on that unit; it does not yet prove frequency calibration, spectrum orientation, RF-path correctness, or sensitivity.

## Capture record template

For each experiment record:

- hardware label and revision;
- host OS and USB topology;
- exact user action and starting state;
- control request type, request, value, index, length, and payload hash;
- bulk endpoint, direction, transfer lengths, timing, and payload fixture hash;
- at least two repeated captures and one negative/control capture;
- the narrow conclusion supported by the observation;
- alternative explanations not yet excluded.

Serial numbers and unrelated host traffic must be removed before committing evidence.

## Daemon compatibility investigation (2026-07-12)

With SDRTrunk left on its RTL-only path and the proprietary SDRplay service
unloaded, a direct OpenRSP bulk capture at 2.048 MS/s ran for 20 seconds and
wrote 40,632,320 complex signed-16-bit samples (155 MiB).  The capture had a
non-zero peak of 29,696 and changing sample values.  This repeated the direct
transport milestone with a longer bounded run.

The API-compatibility daemon did *not* pass a hardware stream test.  Its
configuration request succeeded, then endpoint `0x81` stalled while submitting
the initial asynchronous transfer queue.  The original daemon queue was eight
64 KiB transfers; the known-good direct tool uses thirty-two 256 KiB transfers,
so the daemon now uses that observed geometry.  This is a hypothesis under
test, not a validated fix: a subsequent test began after the RSPduo had stopped
enumerating following the failed stream and therefore could not acquire a
device.

The prior RSPduo-specific LNA GPIO gain sequence is also excluded from the
daemon path until it is proven across LNA states.  It was present in the failed
test's configuration path.  Gain updates currently use the proven generic
Mirics register setter with documented total gain-reduction mapping.  That is
less feature-complete than a validated per-LNA implementation, but it avoids
claiming a control sequence is safe when the hardware result says otherwise.

Required next evidence: restore USB enumeration, repeat the compatibility
stream test from a power-clean state, then run repeated tune/gain updates and
an unplug/replug recovery test.  No compatibility install should be presented
as stable until those tests pass.
